### 1. Fork the Repository
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the repository page. This action will create a copy (fork) of the GDSC AEC India Official Website repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
   - After forking, you'll need to clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
     
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/gdsc-aec-web
     ```
     
   - Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Explore the Codebase
   - Take some time to explore the project's codebase. You can do this by navigating through the files and directories in the cloned repository.

### 4. Check the Issues
   - Visit the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gdsc-aec-india/gdsc-aec-web/issues) page of the repository.
   - Look for issues that interest you or match your skill level. If you're new to open source or web development, search for issues labeled as "beginner-friendly" or "Hacktoberfest" to find tasks suitable for beginners.

### 5. Create a New Branch
   - Before making changes, it's essential to create a new branch dedicated to your work. Use the following command to create a new branch with a descriptive name:

     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

### 5. Create a New Branch
   - Before making changes, it's essential to create a new branch dedicated to your work. Use the following command to create a new branch with a descriptive name:

     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
     
   - Replace `feature/your-feature-name` with a short, meaningful name that describes the changes you plan to make. This naming convention is a common practice, but you can choose a different name if it makes more sense for your specific contribution.

### 6. Make Changes
   - Write your code, fix bugs, or add new features to the GDSC AEC India Official Website. You can use your preferred code editor for this.

### 7. Test Your Changes
   - Ensure that your changes work as expected by testing them locally. You can open the HTML file in a web browser to preview the changes.

### 8. Commit Your Changes
   - Once you're satisfied with your work, you need to stage your changes and then commit them. First, add the changes to the staging area using the following command:

     ```sh
     git add .
     ```
     
   - This command stages all changes in your working directory for the next commit.

   - After adding your changes, commit them with a descriptive commit message using the following command:

     ```sh
     git commit -m "Add a descriptive commit message here"
     ```
     
   - Provide a clear and concise commit message that explains what your changes do.

   - Your changes are now committed and ready to be pushed to your forked repository.

### 9. Push Your Changes
   - Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command:

     ```sh
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

### 10. Open a Pull Request

   - Click the "New Pull Request" button to open a new pull request.
   - In the pull request description, provide details about the changes you made and why they are valuable. Make sure the checklist is completed.
